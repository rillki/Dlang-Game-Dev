# Dlang Game Dev

The main purpose of this project is to inspire more people to use D programming language for their Game Dev projects, and to help newcomers and beginner programmers learn D language in a more engaging manner.

### Dependencies
- Raylib (raylib-d)

### Game resources (music, textures, images, etc...)
All of the game resources are either made by myself or downloaded from the internet under 'copyright free' lisence. All of the credits go to their respective creators. 

### How to compile
1. Clone the repository using git: `git clone https://github.com/rillki/Dlang-Game-Dev.git`
2. Change the directory to `cd Dlang-Game-Dev/doodleJump`
3. Use DUB to build and run a game: `dub` 

DUB is D's package manager. It will fetch all the necessary dependencies, compile and execute these games automatically. To learn more about D, check out my (Dlang Game Dev tutorail)[https://github.com/rillki/learn-dlang].

Enjoy!
